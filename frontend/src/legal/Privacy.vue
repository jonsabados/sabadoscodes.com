    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This site is largely a technical playground designed to allow me to play with various technologies that might
      be used in more real world implementations. As such, it has features enabled that can gather personal information
      that you should be aware of.

    <h2>Tracking for analytics</h2>
    <p>
      If you opt in to the analytics tracking features of this site Google analytics will be turned on. Although this
      site will not directly store any data as a result of this it will trigger Google analytics to collect data on you.
      As this is an educational site a variety of features that will share data with Google may be turned on, and this
      may enable demographic and behavior tracking. If you have the slightest concern about remaining anonymous you
      should simply choose the <i>Do Not Track Me, Ever</i> option when prompted. Note, this will set a cookie
      indicating this preference on your browser. You may also opt out of Google analytics globally using Google's
      analytics opt-out browser add-on which is available
      <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">here</a>.
