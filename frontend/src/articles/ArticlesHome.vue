    <h1>Thoughts and Ramblings</h1>
    <p>
      Since family and friends on Facebook probably don't want to hear any of my ramblings about tech, and since
      re-inventing the wheel with a content posting solution is the type of thing that would be fun but I would never
      do in a professional setting this is my dumping ground for babbling about tech that interests me.
