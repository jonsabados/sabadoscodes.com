      Hello, and welcome to sabadoscodes.com, my personal development playground. Right now it isn't much more than
      a basic <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> application pushed to an S3 bucket sitting behind
      CloudFront, but thanks to the various AWS services available these days its also a place where I can push actual
      code out to fuss with on the cheap.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those that are curious all the code behind this site & the terraform for the infrastructure is available in
      GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jonsabados/sabadoscodes.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
