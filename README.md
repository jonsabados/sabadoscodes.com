# sabadoscodes.com

This is the repository for my little playground in AWS. In the [frontend](frontend/README.md) directory you will find
the frontend application, and in the [infrastructure](infrastructure/README.md) directory you will find the terraform
that controls infrastructure. If you want to get your own sabadoscodes.com instance up and running for whatever reason
you should follow the instructions in the infrastructure README, then push the frontend (despite the name it isn't
tied to the actual domain name of sabadoscodes.com).

For a more detailed explanation of the various pieces and how they interact check out [this article](https://sabadoscodes.com/articles/article/0)
on the actual [sabadoscodes.com](https://sabadoscodes.com)
